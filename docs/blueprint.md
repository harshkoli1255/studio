## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#3498db) to represent trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#ecf0f1) for a clean, modern look.
- Accent color: Orange (#e67e22) for highlighting calls to action, like the voting button. A less saturated version of orange (#f39c12) will be used for non-essential UI elements such as display-only information. 
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern and readable sans-serif font suitable for all text elements.
- Use simple, clear icons for candidate photos and voting options.
- Clean, straightforward layout with a focus on ease of use. Candidate details should be clearly presented. High information density on admin pages.
- Subtle animations, such as a loading indicator after voting or a gentle highlight on candidate selections.
